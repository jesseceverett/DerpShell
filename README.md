Summary of Files:
  To help keep the project organized some of the code that drives the shell is kept seperate from the lex and yacc files
  shell.y and shell.l. These files can be found in the directory dev.
    
  **dev/data_structures/*** contains the implementation for important data structures such as a linked list.
  **dev/user_created_commands.c** contains the implementation of user created functions such as execute_externel_command
  that would have created too much clutter in the file yacc.
